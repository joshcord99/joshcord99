# My Passion for Technology
![](https://github.com/joshcord99/Joshua-Cordial-The-Programmer/blob/main/public/AvatarMaker-2.png)
My name is Joshua Cordial, and my passion for technology began at a young age with my mom’s HP Pavilion dv9000, a heavy laptop with a light blue lid and a CD ROM. Whenever an issue came up with that laptop, I would help her troubleshoot and guide her on how to navigate her own computer. Eventually, that laptop became my little oasis, where I’d get lost in the screen, fascinated by how it worked and the endless possibilities it held. Growing up, and even now, technology is my escape from life’s toughest moments, whether it was playing the latest games on my Nintendo DS as a child or exploring and creating new software as an adult. Over time, it became such a big part of my life that understanding both hardware and software felt natural, and I could quickly adapt to any new technology, customizing it to make it my own. I never explored the idea that a career in tech was feasible, since early in my life my family praised nursing as the ideal path for me, coming from a traditional Filipino family background. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t my path. I realized that if I could help people through technology, it would bring me far more fulfillment, especially because I’ve always been drawn to creating something from my own ideas to inflict any positive change, small or big, or contribute to a resource that could help not just one, but a vast amount of people, creating real and permanent change for them. So I took the leap, and now I’m determined to land on my feet doing something I truly enjoy. Technology and I have always had a close relationship, and I look forward to continuing to grow that connection to solve real problems and make a positive difference for humanity.
